**LearnoHub AI** is an interactive, responsive web-based learning platform for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The application offers a structured learning path with real-time feedback quizzes, right in your browser!

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **User Authentication System**
   - Seamless login and registration handled securely via the browser’s `localStorage`.
   - Dedicated user profiles that safely segregate and track individual progress locally without needing a backend server!
   - Proper validation checking for email syntax and password matching.
   
2. **Structured Learning Modules**
   - Three dedicated learning modules built to ease students into the AI world:
     - **Beginner**: *What is AI?* & *Machine Learning 101*
     - **Intermediate**: *Neural Networks*
     - **Advanced**: *AI in the Real World*
   - Clear explanations paired directly with real-world examples and interactive reading cards.

3. **Built-in Quizzes & Assessments**
   - Each module difficulty contains a 5-question Multiple Choice Quiz to test knowledge.
   - Beautiful visual feedback alerts you instantly if your chosen answer is correct or incorrect.

## 💻 How to Run Locally

Because LearnoHub AI is completely frontend-based and utilizes local browser memory, it is incredibly easy to run!

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the `frontend` folder.
3. Once inside the folder, simply **double-click the `index.html` file** to open it natively in your default internet browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
4. No installations, package managers, or `npm` commands are required!

*(Note: Certain advanced web browser strict security settings restrict JavaScript when running natively from `file://`. If you experience issues, use a lightweight local server proxy like VS Code's "Live Server" extension).*
